# Presentation

This is an AndroidStudio project for Karolina Czapla's self-introduction.

User can navigate through the app using bottom navigation panel.
- First window contains photo and some basic information about the author.
- Second window contains information about the degree that author is pursuing as well as two expandable lists:
  - a list of currently taken courses
  - a list of already done courses
- Third window contains information about author's work experience, including her responsibilities in each of the positions.

The author tried to build everything from scratch.
Thus, even the bottom navigation panel's icons are made manually using VectorDrawable technology.

Here are some screenshots from the app:
